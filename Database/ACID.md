### ATOMICITY
Atomicity guarantee the transaction work have to "Success all" or "Fail all". Transaction guarantee atomicity through `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.
### CONSISTENCY
When a transaction is successfully completed, the database must always remain consistent.
### ISOLATION

One transaction can never interfere with another. That is, the transaction is executed independently. However, this varies slightly from system to system, depending on the level of isolation.
### DURABILITY
After the transaction is complete, the results of the transaction must be permanently stored even if the system fails or a problem occurs.
