HTTP method is the method used when a client requests a task from a server. Each HTTP method represents a specific task and is used primarily by web applications to communicate with the server. HTTP method indicates the action you want to perform on a given resource.
# HTTP Method kind
- **`GET`**: GET method requests the display of a particular resource. Requests that use GET only receive data.
- **`HEAD`**: HEAD method requires the same response as the GET method's request, but does not contain the body of the response.
- **`POST`**: POST method is used to submit entities to specific resources.
- **`PUT`**: PUT method replaces the current display of all destination resources with a request payload.
- **`DELETE`**: DELETE Method deletes certain resources.
- **`CONNECT`**: CONNECT method tunnels to the server identified as the destination resource.
- **`OPTIONS`**: OPTIONS method is used to establish communication for the destination resource.
- **`TRACE`**: TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path of the destination resource.
- **`PATCH`**: The PATCH method is used to modify only the portion of the resource.
