# Why Go?
Go have many Pros.
- **Fast compile speed** : Go is procedural-oriented language, but compile speed is very fast, so it can be written like an interpreter language
- **Binary Code** : Runs without a separate execution package because native binaries are created as a result of compilation
- **Simple grammar** : There are fewer reserved words compared to other languages, but many functions can be performed
- **Garbage Collection** : Memory auto manage
- **GoRoutine** : Go can handle a lot of tasks simultaneously using a light thread called GoRoutine, which gives it great performance in multi-core CPU environments
