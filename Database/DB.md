### Network database
Another early database, the network data model, allowed one child record to have multiple parent records and vice versa.
### Relational database
In the 1980s, the relational database emerged as a popular enterprise model due to its productivity, flexibility, and compatibility with faster hardware. Relational databases organized records as several tables instead of linked lists.
