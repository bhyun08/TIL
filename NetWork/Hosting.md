Hosting mean leasing network resources and server's storage to provide a website or service to the Internet. To make a website or application accessible to others, the data must be stored on the server and connected over the Internet. Hosting is a service that provides the necessary server hardware, network, and management resources.
# Hosting type
#### Web Hosting
It is a service that provides the space necessary to publish a website on the Internet. Users can run a website by uploading their own files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).
#### VPS Hosting
It is a service that allows users to use the server independently by dividing one server into several virtual servers. Although physical server resources are divided, users can set up and manage them as if they were using their own servers.
#### Cloud Hosting
Multiple servers are connected in a cluster to provide services based on cloud infrastructure. Because resources are distributed, they are flexible and scalable.
#### Dedicated Server Hosting
This is the way one user uses the entire server exclusively; it is highly performing and suitable for high traffic or complex applications.
#### Managed Hosting
Hosting providers take care of server management, maintenance, security, backup, and more. Users can focus on websites or applications without the technical burden of server operations.
