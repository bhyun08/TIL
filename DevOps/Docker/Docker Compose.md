Docker Compose is a tool that helps you easily define and manage applications that use multiple containers. Docker containers are a technology used to run the processes of individual applications in isolated environments, but complex applications often require multiple containers to work together. These containers can be easily set up and managed using Docker Components. It allows you to define all the containers, networks, and volumes for your application in a single file. This file is called a ‚Äú`docker-compose.yml`‚Äù file.

# Docker Compose Pros
1. **Multiple Container**: Docker Components help you manage applications composed of multiple containers as a single configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`).
2. **Network Automation**: Docker Components automatically establish the networking required between services, allowing different containers to communicate with each other on the same network, each of which can be accessed automatically by a domain name.
3. **CI/CD**: Docker components can be easily integrated into automated testing or CI/CD pipelines. Docker components in a test environment allow applications to conduct consistent testing using the same settings used in a production environment.
