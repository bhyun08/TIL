# Docker Container Pros
#### Isolation
Containers run applications in an independent environment, so they are not affected by other containers or systems.
#### Portability
Once you create a container, you can run it the same way anywhere, minimizing the difference between development, testing, and deployment environments.
#### Lightweight
Docker containers are lighter and faster than virtual machines because they do not virtualize the operating system and share the resources of the host operating system.
#### Secure
Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry.
