Kotlin is run on the JVM(Java-Virtual-Machine). JVM is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. So, Kotlin can run on the JVM.

Kotlin also goes through a transformation process, the same as Java.

First, All Kotlin Files extension is `.kt`.        
So, All Kotlin Files is transformed by **Kotiln Compiler**. Kotlin Compiler transform `.kt` file as `.class` file. And all `.class` files are packaged jar.       
Finally, `.jar` file can run Java Runtime Environment.
