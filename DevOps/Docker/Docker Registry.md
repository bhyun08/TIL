# Docker Hub
It's the most well-known **public registry**. It's accessible to anyone, basically, Docker setting to download and upload Docker image through Docker hub.
# Private Registry
Instead of a publicly accessible registry like Docker Hub, you can also set up a private registry that is managed in-house, which allows you to keep images that are only used within your company or protect sensitive data. You can install and use Docker Registry provided by Docker directly, or use managed registers based on the cloud, such as `Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)` on AWS, `Azure Container Registry`, and `Google Container Registry`.
# Pull & Push
- **Push**: Developers upload local or build images to the registry.
- **Pull**: Image can be downloaded (pulled) by another user or system, typically used to deploy an application. 

**Way to push and pull images.**

Push:
```bash
docker push username/repository:tag
```

Pull:
```bash
docker pull username/repository:tag
```
