While studying, a question came to mind: "What is the difference between .class files and class? So, I wanted to know answer this question. 
# .class file
To solve this question, we have to know class file first.      
Class file is aÂ file containingÂ Java byte codeÂ that can be executed on theÂ JVM. A class file is a conversion file in the file `.java` that the JVM can understand.
# class
Class is a tool for creating objects. So, class's file extension is `.java` and is transformed by JVM to class file.
# Why I was it confusing
Because, When I programming use **IntelliJ IDEA** and when make a file, there is a class among the list to choose from, and I thought that if I chose a class, the extension would be `.class`. 

In other word, it's happening ðŸ˜‚
