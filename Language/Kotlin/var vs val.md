Kotlin's basic variable divided **var** and **val**.   

# var
var is can change variable (Mutable)       
- variables declared var, may change their values multiple times during program running         
- so may change that you don't want       
# val
var is cannot change variable (Immutable)        
- if allocate variable declared var once, cannot reallocate variable             
- be used like a constant       
- only read initialization value   
- val likes Java's keyword "final"
