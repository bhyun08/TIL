HTTP is an abbreviation of **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**. As you can also know from the name, HTTP is Communication Protocol. So, HTTP is communication **rule**. Because HTTP is text, We can read communication status easily. 

HTTP is consist of **Request** and **Response**.

These messages are called **HTTP message**.
# HTTP Message
HTTP Message divide Request and Response.
## HTTP Request
HTTP Request is the way Internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website. In other word, It means that the client sends a message to the server.

HTTP Request is contains these information.
1. HTTP Version
2. Request Target (`path to send a request`)
3. HTTP Method
4. HTTP Request header
5. Optional HTTP body

To send these information, HTTP Request divide into three main categories.
### Start line
Start line contains HTTP Version, HTTP Method, Request Target    
ex) `GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1`
### Headers
HTTP Request headers communicate core information, such as what browser the client is using and what data is being requested.
