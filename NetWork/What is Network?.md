AÂ **computer network**Â is a set ofÂ computersÂ sharing resources located on or provided by [[Network Node]]. In other words, it refers to connecting distributed computers through a communication network. In a computer network, computing devices use node-to-node connections (data links) to exchange data with each other. These data links are established through cable media such as wired, optical cables, or wireless media such as Wi-Fi. 

Network Nodes may include hosts such as personal computers, phones, servers, and network hardware. These two devices, regardless of whether they are directly connected to each other, are grouped together when one device can exchange information with another. In most cases, application-specific communication protocols are layered compared to other more general communication protocols.
# Network History
The commands between the mathematical calculator and the early computer were mainly delivered directly by humans. When J.C.R. Licklider developed a working group called the Interplanetary Network in 1962, connecting computers with output systems like telegraphs was a great deal of attention. This interplanetary network later became the predecessor of ARPAnet. 

In 1964, Dartmouth researchers developed a time-sharing system for users of large computer systems. That same year, a research group at MIT, supported by General Electric and Bell Labs, used DEC's PDP-8 computer to manage phone connections and control routing. In 1968, Paul Baran proposed a network system composed of packets or datagrams that could be used in a packet-switched network between computer systems. By 1969, UCLA, SRI (in Stanford), UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah connected to form the early ARPAnet using 50 kbit/sec lines.
