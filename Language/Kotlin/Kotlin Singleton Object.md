Singleton is design pattern that about one class, create one instance. Kotlin support this design pattern as **Object class**. When you declare an object using the object keyword, it is used as a singleton object.
## Companion Object
Companion Object can declare static member(static filed, static method). Companion object is created inside of class. Companion object play a role like java `static` keyword. Composition object is used like a static member of a class and never create instance.
