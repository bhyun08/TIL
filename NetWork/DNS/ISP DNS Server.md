- **Local DNS server**: Because your ISP's DNS servers provide servers close to your location, they provide high-speed DNS lookup speeds by default, especially within your network.
- **Cache**: The DNS server of the ISP also maintains a cache for domain names, reducing lookup time for frequently requested domains.
- **Content Filtering**: Some ISPs may block certain websites or content through DNS servers, depending on the regulations or policies of a particular country. For example, if a particular site is legally blocked, access to that site may be restricted through your ISP's DNS server.

- The ISP's primary DNS server is located closest to the user's Internet connection, which can be faster in terms of physical distance. It also ensures a certain level of performance thanks to the ISP's network optimization.
- [[Public DNS Server]] are global DNS servers such as Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`) and Google (`8.8.8.8`) that can provide better performance and security. Users can change to these public DNS servers in their own network settings.
