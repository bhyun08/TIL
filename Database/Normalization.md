Normalization is a principle that in database design, reduce database's redundancy and guarantee data integrity. Database normalization is worked by split the data into several smaller tables, and define the relationship between these tables.

Normalization is divided step by step, and as the step increases, the normalization condition of the lower step is satisfied, and the degree of normalization becomes severe.
## 1NF(First Normal Form)
All fields must have atomic values (no more divisible values), which means that a field must not contain multiple values. 
## 2NF(Second Normal Form)

## 3NF(Third Normal Form)
## BCNF(Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
## 4NF(Fourth Normal Form)
## 5NF(Fifth Normal Form)
